# DISEASE-PREDICTION
This project presents an AI-powered medical diagnosis system implemented as a Streamlit-based web application for disease prediction. The system utilizes machine learning models trained on medical datasets to predict multiple diseases, including diabetes, kidney disease, Parkinson's syndrome, ADHD syndrome, and cancer.
# 🏥 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project uses **Streamlit** to create a web-based disease prediction system. It allows users to input test results, which are processed using **machine learning models** to predict multiple diseases, including:  
✅ **Diabetes**  
✅ **Kidney Disease**  
✅ **Parkinson's Syndrome**  
✅ **ADHD Syndrome**  
✅ **Cancer**  

## 🚀 Features  
- User-friendly **Streamlit interface**  
- **Machine Learning models** for accurate predictions  
- Secure **user authentication** (if implemented)  
- Supports multiple diseases  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Streamlit**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Pandas & NumPy**  

## 📥 Installation & Setup  
1. Clone this repository:
