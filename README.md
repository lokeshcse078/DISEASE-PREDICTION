# Deep Learning Approaches for Thermal Image Classification in Diabetic Foot Ulcer Detection

## Overview
This project explores deep learning techniques for classifying thermal images to detect diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other deep learning architectures, we aim to improve early detection and diagnosis of DFU.

## Features
- **Thermal Image Processing**: Utilizes thermal imaging data for enhanced ulcer detection.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implements CNN-based architectures for classification.
- **Dataset Handling**: Preprocessing, augmentation, and normalization of thermal image datasets.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dfu-detection.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd dfu-detection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
# Run the training script
python train.py

# Perform inference on a new image
python predict.py --image sample.jpg
```

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of thermal images labeled for diabetic foot ulcer classification.
- Preprocessing steps include resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

## Model Training
- The model is trained using CNN-based architectures.
- Training includes data augmentation, dropout regularization, and early stopping.

## Evaluation Metrics
